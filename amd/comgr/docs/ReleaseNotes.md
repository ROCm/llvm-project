Significant Known Problems
--------------------------
- Several Comgr actions currently write and read files from the filesystem,
which is a known performance issue. We aim to address this by improving
clang's virtual file system support
- Several Comgr actions currently fork new processes for compilation actions. We
aim to address this by librayizing llvm tools that are currently only useable as
a separate process.
