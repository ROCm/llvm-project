Using `rocprof` with OpenMP
-----------------------------

The following steps describe a typical workflow for using `rocprof` with OpenMP code compiled with AOMP:

1. Run `rocprof` with the program command line:

  .. code-block:: bash
  
      % rocprof <application> <args>
    

    This produces a `results.csv` file in the userâ€™s current directory that shows basic stats such as kernel names, grid size, number of registers used etc. The user can choose to specify the preferred output file name using the
    o option.

2. Add options for a detailed result:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      --stats: % rocprof --stats <application> <args>
   

   The stats option produces timestamps for the kernels. Look into the output CSV file for the field, `DurationNs`, which is useful in getting an understanding of the critical kernels in the code.

   Apart from `--stats`, the option `--timestamp` on produces a timestamp for the kernels.

3. After learning about the required kernels, the user can take a detailed look at each one of them. `rocprof` has support for hardware counters: a set of basic and a set of derived ones. See the complete list of counters using
   options --list-basic and --list-derived. `rocprof` accepts either a text or an XML file as an input.

For more details on `rocprof`, refer to the {doc}`ROCProfilerV1 User Manual <rocprofiler:rocprofv1>`.
